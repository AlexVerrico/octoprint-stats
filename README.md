# OctoPrint-Stats

This plugin is designed to show statistics of your printer and estimate power usage in kWh.

## Setup

**Important! You may need to install the system package libatlas-base-dev for this plugin to work by running `sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev`.  
Some users have also reported that instead of libatlas-base-dev, they needed to install the system package libopenblas-dev by running `sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev`.**

### Python 3:
Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

### Python 2:

Please note that the Python 2 version will no longer receive updates, it is strongly recommended that you switch your octoprint install to Python 3
